## 🧠 **Design Pattern Vocabulary**

### 🎯 **Creational Patterns**

- **`create`** – Instantiate a new object or resource.
- **`build`** – Construct an object with specific components or properties.
- **`initialize`** – Set up an object with necessary values or state.
- **`prototype`** – Create a new instance by copying an existing one.
- **`singleton`** – Ensure only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.

### 🧩 **Structural Patterns**

- **`compose`** – Combine objects to form a larger, more complex structure.
- **`delegate`** – Pass responsibility for an action to another object.
- **`adapt`** – Change the interface of a class to meet client expectations.
- **`facade`** – Provide a simplified interface for a complex system.
- **`proxy`** – Control access to an object by acting as an intermediary.

### 🔄 **Behavioral Patterns**

- **`observe`** – Track changes in an object’s state and respond accordingly.
- **`command`** – Encapsulate a request or action as an object.
- **`strategy`** – Define a family of algorithms and let the client choose which to use.
- **`template`** – Define a structure for an algorithm, but allow customization in subclasses.
- **`state`** – Change behavior based on an object’s internal state.
- **`mediator`** – Simplify communication between objects by using an intermediary.
- **`chain`** – Pass requests through a chain of handlers, each processing part of the request.
- **`memento`** – Capture and restore an object’s state without exposing its internal structure.
- **`iterator`** – Provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.
- **`visitor`** – Perform operations on elements without modifying their classes.
